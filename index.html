                            <h2 class="post-title">Who I Am</h2>
                            <h3 class="post-subtitle">A pre-business student at Brigham Young University majoring in Experience Design and Management. Originally from Indiana, I grew up in a family of seven (including our adorable dog!) where I learned the value of connection and collaboration. Whether I'm exploring new countries, enjoying the outdoors, or spending quality time with family and friends, I'm constantly inspired by the people and places around me. These experiences shape how I see the world and inform my approach to design.</h3>

                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">As an aspiring Experience Designer, I combine creativity with strategic thinking to craft meaningful interactions. Currently, I serve as a Marketing Intern at GlobalHub, where I develop engaging digital content and execute creative campaigns. I'm also an Event Planning Intern with the Experience Design Society, where I design multi-scale events that enhance student experiences and foster professional development. My background includes leadership roles at BYUSA and hands-on experience in customer service and team management, all of which have strengthened my ability to understand people's needs and deliver exceptional experiences.</h3>

                            <h2 class="post-title">What Drives Me</h2>
                            <h3 class="post-subtitle">I'm passionate about creating and designing experiences that truly matter to people. There's something incredibly fulfilling about transforming an idea into reality—building something meaningful from nothing. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can work alongside talented teammates to push creative boundaries. My commitment to excellence drives me to refine every detail until it's polished and professional. Whether I'm planning an event for 1,200 guests or designing a marketing campaign, I approach each project with dedication, hard work, and a genuine desire to make an impact.</h3>

                            <h3 class="post-subtitle">When I'm not designing experiences, you'll find me exploring the world—I've traveled to over 15 countries and counting! I love capturing beauty and memories through photography, whether hiking scenic trails or boating with friends. Fitness is a big part of my life; I enjoy challenging myself at the gym and staying active outdoors. I'm also passionate about fashion and personal style, finding joy in creating polished looks that help people express themselves. Other favorites include painting, getting lost in a good book, and of course, anything Disney. These interests fuel my creativity and remind me to find beauty in everyday moments.</h3>
